# Quick introduction

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.2.

This is a feedback component, where you can rate a certain service. Was developed using: **Angular, TS, Bootstrap, SCSS, Firebase/Firestore.**
I'm proud of this part of a project, because it's simple, a few lines of code, responsive, and does all the things it's supposed to do. I like to think and brainstorm before coding, because I want to make each app in a way that is simple and also very light for browsers because it can make it easier to find in the web browser because of SEO, now that I have more experience, I take it as a given, that thinking about the architecture of the web or application is important, I'll go out on a limb and say that it's 60% more important than just coding in the first instance. This code is simple, plus it has a great design, the user will not have any doubts about how to use it.
