# Feedback

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.2.

This is a feedback component, where you can rate a certain service. Was developed using: **Angular, TS, Bootstrap, SCSS, Firebase/Firestore.**
I feel proud of this part of a project, because is simple, a few lines of code, responsive and accomplish every function thats mean to be done.
I like to think and do some brainstorming before coding, because I want to make every app in way that is simple and also that is very light for explorers because you can make easier to find on web browser because of the SEO, now that i have more experience I consider as  fact, that design the arquitecture of the web or app you are develop is important, I will take my chances and say that 60% more important that just code at first stance.
This code is simple, also it has a great design, the user will not have any doubt about how to use it.

This code it was comunicated to a firebase/firestore
